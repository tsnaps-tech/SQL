# Downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Analysis performed using SQL.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata;

SELECT distinct artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

SELECT distinct artist_name, count(artist_name), track_name, count(track_name)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

SELECT Distinct track_name, popularity, energy 
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >80
AND artist_name like '%Olivia%'
GROUP BY track_name, popularity, energy
ORDER BY track_name ASC
